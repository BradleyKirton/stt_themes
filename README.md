Includes some themes I ported from vscode to sublime text.

- https://github.com/sobolevn/pustota
- https://github.com/franciscosilva00/gruber-darker-theme-vscode

I did this with an npm package called vscode-theme-to-sublime-text and then converted the tmTheme file to a sublime-color-scheme file.

What could go wrong.
